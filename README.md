# ReadMeFile

## Project Description

As a web developer I feel like whenever I create projects on github, the readme file is something I put off last. I wanted to find a simplier way to create read me files without always having to format it. Thus this project is to generate a simple read me file that consists of a Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing and Test.

## Development

This project was challenging and differed from the usual pace, because everything was done through the server instead of a browser. I am more of a visual person, so this was hard for me to visual how the read me file was going to look like. I would have to say installing npm was definitely something different and then just working in javascript file was new. I had to reference my past read me files in order to make a simple template for myself. I feel like I was having trouble with the badges to work and then just having troubleshooting some of my question input. Overall I felt like this something challenging to do and I'm just glad parts of it work.
